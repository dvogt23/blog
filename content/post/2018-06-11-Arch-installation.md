I was a long time a macbook fanboy. After some wired news about apples macOS, some bugs and so on, I had decide to switch to arch-linux. The os that I use already at work, and I'm very happy with that. So, after this decision i sold macbook and bought a dell xps 13 9370. Now I'm writing this post on my new xps with arch.
