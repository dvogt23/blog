But if you have a case, you need to keep some data in different tables, you need to do it with a specific Rake task.
I had a case for a demo environment, where we are reseting all data every sunday for presentations. But we have some tables with &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; calculation data for different use-cases, that we need to skip in resetting task and skip at re-seeding job.</description></item><item><title>Pair programming with tmux</title><link>/post/2018-12-11-tmux-pair-programming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2018-12-11-tmux-pair-programming/</guid><description>The simpliest way to develop over the network with a colleague or friend in a secure way, is to use ssh[1] and tmux[2]. An alternative is to use a very popular tool named tmate[3]. In my opinion, it is not necessary, because it is so simple to create a new user on your machine and to share your tmux session with them. Only if you haven&amp;rsquo;t a ssh incoming routing, you may use another way.</description></item></channel></rss>
