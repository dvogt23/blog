      <description>The simpliest way to develop over the network with a colleague or friend in a secure way, is to use ssh[1] and tmux[2]. An alternative is to use a very popular tool named tmate[3]. In my opinion, it is not necessary, because it is so simple to create a new user on your machine and to share your tmux session with them. Only if you haven&amp;rsquo;t a ssh incoming routing, you may use another way.</description>

      <description>Maybe I already said that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of pass. A small unix tool (bash-script) for managing passwords with a pgp-key. In this note I collected some introductions for a best practise.
I&#39;m not a profession or a security expert. All this information are for my own use.
The goals in this post are create a pgp master key with multiple id and a subkey.
GPG config At first, some gpg config stuff here.</description>

      <description>I was a long time a macbook fanboy. After some wired news about apples macOS, some bugs and so on, I had decide to switch to arch-linux. The os that I use already at work, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with that. So, after this decision i sold macbook and bought a dell xps 13 9370. Now I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post on my new xps with arch.
